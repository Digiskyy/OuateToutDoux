# OuateToutDoux

OuateToutDoux is a web project performed as part of a course about Software Engineering in the Faculty of Sciences and Technologies in Nancy (France).

This project is a website which aims to enable people working in group to handle tasks, gathered in tasklists.
A user can create a tasklist, add some tasks in and invite some teammates to perform them. It's a minimalist and very handy tool for common project management.

At the beginning, we were two groups of five and six persons  who had to work on the design of this web project. Then, we had to merge in order to work together on that. The goal is for us to learn how to work together in larger group than we usually did.
